# QuickStart: Using the Refactoring Assistant

Follow these steps to apply refactoring patterns to your project:

1. **Identify the Area**: Is it a grammar issue (Optimization) or a code structure issue (Refactoring)?
2. **Review Patterns**: Consult [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) for the relevant section.
3. **Apply Incremental Changes**:
   - Refactor one component at a time.
   - Run tests after each change.
4. **Optimize Grammars**:
   - Check for left-recursion if your parser is failing on deep trees.
   - Consolidate rules to improve speed.
